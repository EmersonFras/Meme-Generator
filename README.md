# Meme Generator Project

This project is part of Scrimba's React course and focuses on practicing key React concepts such as **side effects**, **controlled components**, **fetching data**, and **functional programming**. The Meme Generator is a simple web app that allows users to create custom memes by adding text to randomly generated images.

---

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Meme Generation**:
  - Click a button to fetch and display a random image from a predefined source.
- **Customizable Text**:
  - Add top and bottom text to the image using input fields.
- **React Concepts**:
  - Implementation of controlled components for form inputs.
  - Use of side effects to fetch image data.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **React**: For building the UI and managing state.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming for functionality.
- **CSS**: Styling the app for a simple and clean design.

## **Learning Highlights**

- **Controlled Components**:
  - Use of `useState` to manage form inputs.
  - Synchronization of input fields with React state.

- **Fetching Data**:
  - Using `useEffect` to fetch images from an API or data source.

- **Functional Programming**:
  - Breaking the app into reusable components.
  - Composing functionality for image generation and text overlay.
